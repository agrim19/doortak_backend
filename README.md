## Setting up and running the server
#### Step 1 
Clone the repository from GitHub
#### Step 2 
Move to directory in the terminal
#### Step 3 
npm install
#### Step 4
add dotenv file to directory manually
#### Step 5
npm start

#### Important Points
- Step 5 will start the server on port 8080. Visit localhost:8080 to check. If you get HELLO, means the server is setup fine. 
- If server is started using step 5, don't forget to stop(using cntrl+C) and restart the server(npm start) everytime you make a change in the code and expect to see it.
- Workaround: Install nodemon using 'npm i -g nodemon'. Now, Step 5 will be replaced by 'nodemon' command, which will auto refresh the server.
