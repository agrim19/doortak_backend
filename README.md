## Setting up and running the server
Step 1: Clone the repository from GitHub
Step 2: Move to directory in the terminal
Step 3: npm install
Step 4: npm start

Step 4 will start the server on port 8080. Visit localhost:8080 to check. If you get HELLO, means the server is setup fine. 
Note: If server is started using step 4, don't forget to stop(using cntrl+C) and restart the server(npm start) everytime you make a change in the code and expect to see it.
Workaround: Install nodemon using 'npm i -g nodemon'. Now, Step 4 will be replaced by 'nodemon' command, which will auto refresh the server.
